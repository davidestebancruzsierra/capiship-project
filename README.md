🏆 Biggest Challenge

**Challenge**: Making the website responsive across all devices while maintaining the visual consistency of the Capiship brand, and ensuring proper HTML/CSS validation.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented **CSS Grid and Flexbox** layouts with strategic use of `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax())`
- Created **3 breakpoints** (480px, 768px, 1024px) with comprehensive media queries
- Used **CSS Variables** (custom properties) for consistent theming across all pages
- Applied **`object-fit: contain`** for responsive images that maintain aspect ratio
- Used **`clamp()`** function for fluid responsive typography that scales smoothly
- Fixed HTML validation errors: corrected `aria-control` to `aria-controls` and added proper `role` attributes
- Tested extensively on mobile, tablet, and desktop to ensure seamless responsiveness
